## Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior
The goal of trajectory inference is to recover the law of a stochastic process from temporal marginals. We study this problem under the partially observed setting, where we cannot observe the process directly.

This repository contains the implementation for our paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475).
